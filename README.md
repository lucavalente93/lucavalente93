ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lucavalente93 (Luca Valente). I'm a 24-year-old Brazilian studying Computer Science in college, which is equivalent to an Associate Degree in Computer Science in the US.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning programming and documenting my progress as part of a visible portfolio. My next goal is to get employed and gain practical experience.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Ruby.
