- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lucavalente93 (Luca Valente). I'm a 24 years-old brazilian man and I'm studying CS in college, which is the equivalent to Associate Degree in Computer Science (in US).

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in...
  Learning programming and, in this case, documenting my progress and use it on a visible portfolio. Later on, the next step will be getting employed and putting skin in the game. 
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  Python and Ruby.
