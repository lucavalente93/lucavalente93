ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lucavalente93 (Luca Valente). I'm a 24-year-old Brazilian studying S.E. in college.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning programming and documenting my progress as part of a visible portfolio. My next goal is to finish CS50 in 2025, get employed and gain practical experience.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Ruby, CSS and Javascript.
